The idea is to make any contract omnichain by just mentioning a field as `omni`
create a file `omniapp.osol`

```javascript

contract OmnichainContract {
    omni mapping(addr => myAddr) hello; // This field is sync around now multiple contracts   
}
```

### Use case

### Use Cases for Omnichain Contract States

1. **Unified Balance Management in DeFi Protocols:**
   - **Scenario:** A DeFi protocol operates liquidity pools on multiple chains and wants to manage user balances and rewards seamlessly across all chains.
   - **Omni Benefit:** Instead of creating separate balance management systems on each chain, the protocol can maintain a unified state using the `omni` field. This ensures that user balances are synchronized across all instances of the protocol, allowing users to move funds or earn rewards seamlessly without having to bridge tokens manually.

2. **Cross-Chain Voting and Governance:**
   - **Scenario:** A DAO operates on multiple chains, allowing members to participate in governance and voting on any chain.
   - **Omni Benefit:** By using an `omni` state to track user votes, governance tokens, or proposals, the DAO can ensure that voting power is synchronized across chains. This avoids double voting issues and ensures that decisions reflect the true distribution of tokens and participation.

3. **Omnichain Identity Verification:**
   - **Scenario:** An identity verification protocol that issues verifiable credentials or manages user identities across different blockchains.
   - **Omni Benefit:** The `omni` field can help maintain a consistent and verifiable identity state for a user across all chains, eliminating the need to re-verify on every chain or maintain separate verification records.

4. **Game Asset Synchronization:**
   - **Scenario:** A blockchain-based game with assets, characters, or scores that can be used across multiple chains.
   - **Omni Benefit:** By using `omni` fields, the game can synchronize player progress, assets, or scores across chains, allowing for a seamless gaming experience where players can switch chains without losing progress or items.

5. **Cross-Chain Subscription Services:**
   - **Scenario:** A subscription service that offers content, data, or utilities across multiple blockchains.
   - **Omni Benefit:** The service can manage user subscriptions, payments, and access rights using an `omni` field, ensuring that access is correctly granted or revoked across chains without needing to manage separate states.

6. **Omnichain Supply Chain Management:**
   - **Scenario:** A supply chain platform tracks goods and logistics across different chains for better traceability and accountability.
   - **Omni Benefit:** With an `omni` state, the platform can maintain a unified view of inventory, shipment status, or tracking information across different blockchains, allowing stakeholders to view real-time updates without chain-specific synchronization challenges.

7. **Cross-Chain Payment Streams:**
   - **Scenario:** A protocol handles payment streams (e.g., salaries, royalties) that need to be synchronized across multiple chains.
   - **Omni Benefit:** The `omni` field can be used to manage ongoing payment states, ensuring that recipients are paid correctly across chains, even if the origin or destination of funds spans multiple blockchains.

8. **Decentralized Social Media Platforms:**
   - **Scenario:** A decentralized social media network allows users to post, share, and interact across different blockchains.
   - **Omni Benefit:** By using `omni` fields to synchronize content, user interactions, and follower lists, the platform can ensure consistent user experience and engagement across chains without content duplication.

### Benefits of the `omni` Approach

- **Simplicity:** Developers can manage cross-chain data without complex bridging or synchronization logic.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that data is always up-to-date across chains, preventing inconsistencies.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Simplifies development by treating cross-chain state management as just another field in the contract.
- **Interoperability:** Enables seamless integration of multiple blockchain ecosystems, enhancing user experience.
